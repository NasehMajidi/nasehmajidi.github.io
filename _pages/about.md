I am a **data scientist** at LiveTSE, where I develop automated trading systems for the Tehran Stock Market using machine learning and quantitative analysis. My work focuses on building data-driven solutions to improve financial decision-making. With a background in electrical and computer engineering, I specialize in solving complex problems using **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** and other AI techniques.

My research covers **machine learning** applications in areas like **signal processing**, **medical imaging**, **bioinformatics**, and **communications**. I am particularly interested in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **chatbots**, working to enhance their ability to understand and generate human-like text for real-world applications.

I am proficient in **Python**, **MATLAB**, and **Mathcad**, using these tools to turn theoretical concepts into practical systems.
